# Design Elements
The Equisoft design system.

## Repository Structure
This project is setup as a monorepo containing multiple packages. While closely related, every package in the `/packages/` folder is stand-alone.

Packages meant for use within Equisoft apps are currently being published to [Equisoft's NPM repository](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/equisoft/packages).

Please visit each package's README for installation and usage details.


## Main Packages
To contribute to Design Elements or implement its components in your app, you will most likely have to get familiar with the following packages:

- `/react/`: [React](https://reactjs.org/) implementation of Design Elements. This is our first delivery target.
- `/storybook/`: This package contains the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) documentation for Design Elements' React components. This includes props documentation and components implementation examples.

### Quick start

**Note to Windows users**: If you have `make` installed, you can run it with `make -f Makefile` instead of `make`. If it doesn't work, your best bet is to look at the Makefile and run the commands separately

All the packages are linked together using yarn 2.

```bash
# Running stuff for dev, usually 1 per terminal. Watches files and rebuilds as needed.
make react
make storybook
```

```bash
# Building for production
make build_react
make build_storybook
```
