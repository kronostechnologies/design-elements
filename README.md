# Design Elements
The Equisoft design system.

## Repository Structure
This project is setup as a monorepo containing multiple packages. While closely related, every package in the `/packages/` folder is stand-alone.

Packages meant for use within Equisoft apps are currently being published to [Equisoft's NPM repository](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/equisoft/packages).

Please visit each package's README for installation and usage details.


## Main Packages
To contribute to Design Elements or implement its components in your app, you will most likely have to get familiar with the following packages:

- `/react/`: [React](https://reactjs.org/) implementation of Design Elements. This is our first delivery target.
- `/web/` : Complementary [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) snipets to be used alongside Design Elements components.  On the long term, our goal is for this folder to contain the [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) implementation of Design Elements.
- `/storybook/`: This package contains the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) documentation for Design Elements' React components. This includes props documentation and components implementation examples.
