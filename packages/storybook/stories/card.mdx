## Definition/Overview
Cards allow users to be introduced to a single subject or concept and prompts them to take action, such as clicking for
more details.

## Usage

### When to use
- **One card, one concept**. A card can contain multiple elements, but each card should focus on only one bit of
  information or content. This allows users to browse one card at a time [4].
- Use it to gather heterogeneous information about a single theme to form a more homogeneous page. Cards are an
  excellent choice for displaying a variety of content types at the same time on the same page [3].
- Use when there is a call-to-action related to the card. A card should not only be a structure element, it should
  always lead to some action. A CTA can be in the form of text, an image, a button, or a link. The goal of a CTA is
  to prompt the user to take action.
- Use to visually group digestible portions of information that call for action; like activating an integration, or
  accessing more details rather than the full details themselves. It can be a summary that gives users a hint of what
  they can find on another page, encouraging them to click for more information [1].
- Use when users browse for information. When you design a layout with cards, the key idea is to allow users to
  quickly digest large portions of content and dive deep into their interests [8].

### When not to use
- Do not use cards when your content requires direct comparison. Each card should be independent and should not
  require to be compared with each other.
- Do not use cards to display a search result.
- Do not use cards when the content of the page you want to present is already grouped into very homogenous items
  such as:
    - A list of similar items. While cards can be used for homogenous content, in many cases it’s better to use
      quickly scannable list (or grid) instead of cards for that (simply because the UI will be less complex) [9].
    - Gallery of images. The use of cards can distract the user and prevent easy scannability. A standard grid view
      can be more relevant when it allows the human eye to scan the grid and its items more easily [7].
- Do not use cards when you need to present the information in a strict order. Card layouts deemphasize the ranking
  of content as they don’t provide obvious information about the order in which content should be viewed on a page [7].
  For example, a form or a page with different sections should not use cards, as the order in which information is
  presented is important.
