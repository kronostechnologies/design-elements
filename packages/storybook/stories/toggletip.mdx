## Definition
A Toggletip is a disclosure component used to display additional information about a target element, without the user losing the context of the page [2].
<Canvas of={ToggletipStories.Default} />

## Usage

### When to use
- Use sparingly and only when the information cannot be presented to the user in any other way (e.g. directly on the page)[7].
- Provides additional information about a page element (feature, action, content, etc) [1].
- Use to display instructions or tips that help the user interact with the user interface more effectively.
- Use to provide brief, useful content.
- Use for secondary information [4]. Use it when it is not essential for the user to act on the information or complete a task [2].
- Use when you don‘t want to let the user lose context, but still want to provide additional useful unique information about referring elements. [2].
- Highlight a new feature or important feature that extends or improves the user's experience on the page [8].

### When not to use
- Avoid using it as a workaround for poor user interface design, including confusing organization or presentation of information, inconsistent labeling, difficult-to-use or understand functions, or any other issue that makes the user interface hard to use or not user-friendly.
- Do not use to present critical information.
- Do not use to display important information that should be immediately visible and accessible to the user without requiring additional action.
- Do not use to display information that can be explained directly on the page.
- Do not use unnecessarily: If the text in the Toggletip is obvious or redundant, it won't provide value to the user. Only use a Toggletip when the content is genuinely useful and adds meaningful information.
- Do not use to display hidden extra functionality, or for data entry (form).
- Do not use if you want to display additional information to identify or add a small amount of information to an interactive (host) element when the user hovers over it. Use Tooltip instead.
