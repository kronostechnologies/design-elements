## Definition
A modal is an overlay that requires the user to interact with it and is designed to elicit a response from the user (dialog). Modals inform users about critical information and require users to make decisions. Within apps, on the web and even on mobile, modals are increasingly used to direct the user’s attention to a specific task, without taking them away from the context of the current screen [1].

## Usage

### When to use
- Use when the content is urgent, and users are more likely to notice it in a modal [8].
- Use when it is essential to collect a small amount of information before letting the user proceed further [10].
- Use when you have to convey important information without losing the context of the current screen [10].
- Use when the user is about to take an action that has serious consequences and is difficult to reverse [9].

### When not to use
- Do not use when the content is excessive. Opt instead for concise content to ensure a smooth user experience. Complex modals can overwhelm users, indicating the importance of exploring simpler alternatives [5].
- Do not use for long forms. Consider employing separate pages for longer forms and inline editing for smoother user engagement [6].
- Avoid multi-step modals, which prolong user distraction and increase the likelihood of task abandonment. If it is necessary to use multi-step modals, progress indicators should be provided to keep the user engaged. It is also possible to consider the use of a complete page dedicated to this type of process [7].

## Variants

### Default
<Canvas of={ModalDialogStories.Default} />

### Alert
The alert modal requires confirmation for an action that is highly destructive or irreversible. This modal use an icon, to help people with color vision impairment discern quickly the tone of the message. When there are significant consequences for an action, and you’re concerned users might skip the explanation, include an input to make sure the user confirm the action [3].

## Properties
<ArgTypes of={ModalDialog} />

## Accessibility
It is important for users of screenreaders that other page content be hidden (via the aria-hidden attribute) while the modal is open. To allow `ModalDialog` to do this, you should set `appElement` prop to a query selector identifying the root of your app. For example, if your app content is located inside an element with the ID `root`, you should set the `appElement` prop like this:

```jsx
<ModalDialog
    appElement="#storybook-root"
    isOpen={isModalOpen}
    onRequestClose={closeModal}
>
    Some Content
</ModalDialog>
```
