## Definition
Buttons allow users to trigger targeted actions [1][2][3].
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

## Usage
### When to use
- Use buttons to trigger actions or interactions within the application.

### When not to use
- Do not use buttons component as navigational elements. Instead, use a Link when the desired action is to take the user to somewhere else or a new page [1].
- Do not use buttons for displaying static text or informational content without any associated action.
- Do not use buttons if the action does not require user input or interaction.

## Variants

### Primary
- Use the primary button for the main action of a page.
- Only use one primary button per page. The only exception to this is if one of them is used inside an “overlay” component such as a modal.
  Define the main goal of a page by asking: “What is the most important action I want to do on this page” and use the primary button accordingly.
- Not all pages need to have a primary button. Therefore, it should only be used when an action requires more visual weight than the others.

### Secondary
- Use the secondary button by default.
- If an action requires more visual weight, use the primary button.
- If it requires less visual weight, use the tertiary button.

### Tertiary
- Use the tertiary button for actions that requires less visual weight. Ex: Cancel.
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Tertiary} />

### Destructive primary
- Use the destructive primary button for potentially irreversible actions that must grab attention such as losing data.

### Destructive secondary
- Use the destructive secondary button for potentially irreversible actions that must not grab as much attention as the destructive primary.
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.DestructiveSecondary} />

### Destructive tertiary
- Use the destructive tertiary button for potentially irreversible actions that must not grab as much attention as the destructive secondary.

## States
### Processing / Loading
- A progress button gives users a visual cue that indicates a loading state [12]. When users don't receive feedback that the system is processing their request, they may assume that they didn't press the button correctly. This confusion can lead them to click the button repeatedly, thinking that their initial action didn't register and adds to the system's processing load, potentially causing performance issues [13].
- Use the processing state for actions that take more than two seconds to finish.
- Use to better inform users what's in progress, you should change the button label to describe what the system is doing (ex: change Submit to Submitting...) [12].

## Properties
### With icon
- Use an icon to the left of the label to provide a quick visual feedback.
- Use an icon to the right of the label to indicate a state e.g.: loading state or to indicate the role of the button.
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.PrimaryWithIcon} />

### Icon only
- Use an icon button for actions that can be presented without the need for a text when space is limited.
- The icon used MUST be familiar and easily recognizable and remembered by the average user.
- The icon have a strong visual attribute with the action it triggers.
- Use a tooltip to clarify the action of the icon button.
