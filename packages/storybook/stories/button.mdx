## Definition
Buttons are control elements that allow users to trigger targeted actions [1][2][3]. 


## Usage
### When to use
- Use buttons to trigger actions or interactions within the application.
- Use buttons for primary actions that are essential for completing a task or progressing through a workflow.
- Use buttons for secondary actions that provide additional functionality or options to users.
- Use buttons for form submissions or confirming user input.

### When not to use
- Do not use buttons component as navigational elements. Instead, use a Link when the desired action is to take the user to somewhere else or a new page [1].
- Do not use buttons for displaying static text or informational content without any associated action.
- Do not use buttons if the action does not require user input or interaction.

## Variants

### Primary
- Use the primary button for the main action of a page.
- Only use one primary button per page. The only exception to this is if one of them is used inside an “overlay” component such as a modal. Define the main goal of a page by asking: “What is the most important action I want to do on this page” and use the primary button accordingly.
- Not all pages need to have a primary button. Therefore, it should only be used when an action requires more visual weight than the others.*

### Secondary
- Use the secondary button by default.
- If an action requires more visual weight, use the primary button.
- If it requires less visual weight, use the tertiary button.

### Tertiary
- Use the tertiary button for actions that requires less visual weight. Ex: Cancel.

### Destructive
- Use the destructive primary button for potentially irreversible actions that must grab attention such as losing data .

### Destructive secondary
- Use the destructive button for potentially irreversible actions that must not grab as much attention as the destructive primary.

### With icon

- Use an icon to the left of the label to provide a quick visual feedback.
- Use an icon to the right of the label to indicate a state *e.g.: loading state* or to indicate the role of the button *e.g.: Menu button*

### Icon only
- Use an icon button for actions that can be presented without the need for a text when space is limited.
- The icon used MUST be familiar and easily recognizable and remembered by the average user.
- The icon have a strong visual attribute with the action it triggers.
- Use a tooltip to clarify the action of the icon button.
