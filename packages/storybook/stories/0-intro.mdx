# Equisoft Design System

Welcome to the Equisoft Design System â€“ the cornerstone of our digital ecosystem, meticulously crafted to empower our teams and enhance our product development journey. 
Created to be the single source of truth for our product teams, this design system will guide you to ensure we elevate our usability and coherence within each product. 
It will enable product teams to design and develop with consistency, efficiency, and quality across different projects.


## Objectives

### Consistency
Consistency lies at the heart of the Equisoft Design System. By providing standardized design elements, patterns, and guidelines, we ensure that every product maintains a cohesive look and feel. 
This consistency not only enhances the user experience but also strengthens our brand identity, fostering trust and familiarity among our users.


### Collaboration
The Equisoft Design System fosters collaboration among cross-functional teams, bringing together designers, developers, and stakeholders to work towards a common goal. 
By providing a shared language and set of tools, it facilitates communication and alignment, streamlining the design and development process and ultimately leading to more effective and impactful outcomes.


### Efficiency
Efficiency is key to delivering high-quality products within tight timelines. The Equisoft Design System accelerates the design and development process by offering pre-built components, templates, and workflows. 
By reducing duplication of effort and eliminating guesswork, it enables teams to focus their energy on innovation and problem-solving, driving continuous improvement and delivering value to our users faster.


## Getting Started

#### Add the library to your project
`yarn add @equisoft/design-elements-react`

#### Add the DesignSystem provider to your app

Simply add the provider in your App component. It should be something like this:
```typescript jsx
import { DesignSystem } from '@equisoft/design-elements-react';
import { VoidFunctionComponent } from 'react';
import { Router } from 'react-router';
import { Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

export const App: VoidFunctionComponent = () => (
    <DesignSystem>
        <Router>
            <Switch>
                <Route component={HomeComponent} />
            </Switch>
        </Router>
    </DesignSystem>
);
```

## Theming

For most cases, you won't need to provide a theme, as the DesignSystem uses Equisoft's theme by default. However, it's
possible to override the theme, or parts of the theme. For more details, take a look at the [Theme definition](https://github.com/kronostechnologies/design-elements/blob/master/packages/react/src/themes/theme.ts).

## Internationalization

If your application supports multiple languages, you simply need to sync the selected language in your application with
the `DesignSystem` provider's `language` prop. The default language is **english**.
The following sample shows that the provider only translates the messages
related to the design system. For a more complex example, take a look at the [webapp-boilerplate](https://github.com/kronostechnologies/webapp-boilerplate/tree/master/web/src/browser).
