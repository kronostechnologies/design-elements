# Welcome to the Equisoft Design System
## Introduction
Welcome to the Equisoft Design System â€“ the cornerstone of our digital ecosystem, meticulously crafted to empower our teams and enhance our product development journey. 
Created to be the single source of truth for our product teams, this design system will guide you to ensure we elevate our usability and coherence within each product. 
It will enable product teams to design and develop with consistency, efficiency, and quality across different projects.

## Getting Started

#### Add the library to your project
`yarn add @equisoft/design-elements-react`

#### Add the DesignSystem provider to your app

Simply add the provider in your App component. It should be something like this:
```typescript jsx
import { DesignSystem } from '@equisoft/design-elements-react';
import { VoidFunctionComponent } from 'react';
import { Router } from 'react-router';
import { Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

export const App: VoidFunctionComponent = () => (
    <DesignSystem>
        <Router>
            <Switch>
                <Route component={HomeComponent} />
            </Switch>
        </Router>
    </DesignSystem>
);
```


## Props

<ArgTypes of={DesignSystem} />


## Theming

For most cases, you won't need to provide a theme, as the DesignSystem uses Equisoft's theme by default. However, it's
possible to override the theme, or parts of the theme. For more details, take a look at the [Theme definition](https://github.com/kronostechnologies/design-elements/blob/master/packages/react/src/themes/theme.ts).

## Internationalization

If your application supports multiple languages, you simply need to sync the selected language in your application with
the `DesignSystem` provider's `language` prop. The default language is **english**.
The following sample shows that the provider only translates the messages
related to the design system. For a more complex example, take a look at the [webapp-boilerplate](https://github.com/kronostechnologies/webapp-boilerplate/tree/master/web/src/browser).
