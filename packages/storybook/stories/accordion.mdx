## Definition
Accordion is a **disclosure component** that allows the user to display or hide vertically stacked content.
    <Canvas of={AccordionStories.Default} />

## Usage
### When to use
- When users only need a small amount of information on the page, and the content is not critical: Hiding most of the page content helps users to spend their time more efficiently, concentrating on the few topics that matter [6].
- When the information contained in each section is independent, and users are unlikely to need simultaneous access to several sections [6].
- When content is long and window size is small: Prioritizes content display and reduces page length. Relevant on mobile devices and Side Panel [6].
- When the main task is a logical step-by-step process: Guide users through the process by presenting information relevant to the current step and hiding irrelevant details that may distract or overwhelm users [6].

### When not to use
- When the user needs most or all of the page content: Easy access to essential information is more important than reducing page length [6].
- When there is little content on the page: The absence of content can give the illusion that there is no valuable information on the page [6].
- When the content has a deep hierarchy with multiple sublevels: it may be too complex to be displayed in a flat hierarchy format like accordions. Instead, consider alternatives such as Tabs [6].
- When content is scattered and difficult to summarize: it becomes difficult to break it down and come up with representative headings that effectively convey the essence of the information [6].
- When users are likely to be immersed in a continuous stream of reading: the use of accordions could disrupt the experience by fragmenting information and hindering users' ability to understand the full context [6].
- To display more information, revealing additional content that is initially hidden due to space constraints. Use a "View/Read/Show more" button instead [6].
