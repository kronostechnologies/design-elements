# Accordion Component
<Meta of={AccordionStories} />
The Accordion component offers a robust Accessibility implementation, along with lots of flexibility on content and controls.<br />
Accordion controls whether multiple panels can remain open concurrently, or if the behavior restricts expansion to only one panel at a time.<br />
Each AccordionItem has the capacity to accommodate a diverse range of content â€“ spanning from basic text to intricate HTML elements.<br />
Also, controls disable and collapse by default options implemented per item.<br />
