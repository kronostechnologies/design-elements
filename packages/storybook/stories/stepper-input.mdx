## Definition
Stepper input is a control element that allows users to enter a numeric value and incrementally increase or decrease the value with a two-segment buttons [2].

## Usage
### When to use 
- To quickly set and specify values [2].
- To adjust small values when increasing or decreasing them requires only a few clicks [1-2].
- When users may not know exact values and only want to change the values that are relative to their current state [2].

### When not to use 
- If itâ€™s likely that the user will deviate from the default amount. Use the numeric input instead.
- If the user does not need to know what the limits are. Use the numeric input instead.
- If there is a wide range of numeric options. Use the slider instead.
- If the user needs to be able to see the minimum and the maximum numbers. Use the slider instead.
- For continuous variables such as prices, distances, lengths, or human heights where specifying an exact value within a broad range is crucial, opt for numeric input or money input instead [1-2].

## Variants
### Default
By default a stepper input allows users to enter and modify a numeric value without thresholds. Use this variant when any value within the range of the numeric input is valid for your use case [3].
