## Definition
A sectional banner displays a non-intrusive message inserted into a content area to 
communicate important information that may affect the user's experience.
<Canvas of={SectionalBannerStories.Neutral} />

## Usage
### When to use
- Use a sectional banner to communicate important information, warnings, discovery messages, or alerts within a specific section of a screen.
- Use a sectional banner to highlight information that needs to be emphasized so the user can complete a task within the application.
- Use a sectional banner to notify the user of task-generated or system-generated events [2]:
  - **Task-Generated Banner**: Triggered by user actions during a specific task, these banners provide direct, immediate feedback. They should be placed in the area where the user is working and be related to the user's action.
    - Example: To notify users of the status of an action or system update [1].
  - **System-Generated Banner**: Initiated by the application or system, independent of user action, these banners provide updates on background system status or events related to a specific section.
    - Example: To inform users of updates or changes to system status [1].
- Use a sectional banner to give feedback that needs to remain visible on the page.

### When not to use
- Do not use sectional banners for messages that don’t require emphasis [2].
- Do not use sectional banners when the message is not directly related to the content or activity within the specific section [2].
- Do not overload sections with repetitive or redundant banners, as this can cause visual fatigue and degrade the user experience [2].
- Do not use sectional banners for messages that concern the entire application rather than a specific page. In such cases, use a Global Banner instead.
