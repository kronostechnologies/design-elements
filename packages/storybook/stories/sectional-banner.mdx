## Definition
A sectional banner is a notification element that displays a non-intrusive message inserted into a content area to communicate important information that may affect the user's experience.
<Canvas of={SectionalBannerStories.Neutral} />

## Usage
### When to use
- To communicate important information in a section of a screen.

There are two major use cases for notifications: task-generated and system-generated [2] : 

- Task-generated banner: Task-generated banner are initiated in response to user action during a specific task. They give users direct, immediate feedback. They should be placed in the region of the page the user is working in and be related to the user’s action.
    - e.g. To notify users of the status of an action or system [1].
- System-generated banner : These banner are initiated by the application or system, independent of user action. They provide updates on background system status or on events related to a specific section.
    - e.g. To inform users of updates or changes to system status [1].

### When not to use
- When banners don't communicate important information that needs to be promoted [2].
- When they are not directly related to the content or activity of the specific section [2].
- When they are redundant. Avoid overloading sections with repetitive or redundant banners, which can lead to visual fatigue and a degraded user experience [2].
- When the message concerns the entire application and not a specific page. Use Global Banner instead.

## Variants
### Neutral
Neutral banners are used to provide additional information to the user that doesn’t need to grab too much attention. This variation is used to inform the user about something that might help or impact their journey.
- Can be dismissed by the user or the application, depending on the content.
- Does not require immediate action.

### Informative
Like Neutral banners, Informative banners are used to provide additional information to the user, but instead with the purpose of grabbing its attention. This variant is also used to inform the user of something that could help them or have an impact on their journey, but with a higher level of importance.
- Can be dismissed by the user or the application, depending on the content.
- Does not require immediate action.

### Success
Success banners are used to let the user know that an action or event has been successful. This variation is used when the user needs the feedback to be delayed, persistent or if a call to action is needed. If not, use the component "toast".
- Can be dismissed by the user manually, automatically, through a timer, or it can persist, depending on the content.
