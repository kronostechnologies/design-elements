## Definition

Drop zone allows users to upload files by dragging and dropping the files (or folders) into an area on a page, or activating a button [2].

<Canvas of={AttachedFileStories.Default} />

## Usage

### When to use

- Use when you need to display files that users have uploaded, such as documents, images, or other attachments.
- Use alongside the Dropzone component to visually represent files that users have dragged and dropped into an upload area.
- Use when you want to provide users with real-time feedback on the status of their file uploads, including progress indicators and success/error states.
- Use when you want to allow users to perform actions on uploaded files, such as deleting or retrying a failed upload.
- Use in forms where users are required to upload and manage documents, ensuring they can easily add, view, and manage their files as part of the submission process.
- Use when you want to enforce file type, size restrictions, or other validation rules.

### When not to use

- Do not use if you need to display content directly on the page rather than as an attachment.
- Do not use for files requiring complex interactions such as in-line editing, annotation, or version control.

## States

### Default

The Default state is the final state of the attached file, following the Success state.

### Uploading

The Uploading state is the initial state of the attached file, indicating the progress of the file as it is being imported into the application.

### Error

The Error state occurs when there is an issue with the upload. Possible issues include:

- Unsupported file type.
- Upload failure.

### Success

The Success state confirms that the attached file has been successfully uploaded. This state is displayed briefly (2 seconds) before transitioning to the Default state.
