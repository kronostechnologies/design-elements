# Progress Indicator (Spinner)

## Definition
The progress indicator represents the progress status of an ongoing process. It provides immediate feedback to users, signaling that the application or a specific element of the page is processing an action and requires some time to complete.

## Usage
### When to use
- When you want to inform users about the status of a process that takes time.
- For processes requiring more than 1 second.
- Use to integrate into a button or other components to express a connection between an interaction and a specific item.

### When not to use
- For durations less than 1 second.
- Don’t use inline loading for full page loads, use skeleton states instead [2].
- Don’t use in combination with a skeleton. Choose one or the other, depending on which best fits the use case.
- Don’t trigger inline loading on more than one item or action at a time, unless on initial page load or refresh [2]. If a larger section of content is loading, consider using a larger size spinner instead of multiple smaller ones or a "skeleton” instead [8].
- Don’t use when you know what the populated data is going to look like (even if it results in an empty state). use instead the "skeleton." [10].

## Variants

### Spinner
- Use when the duration or progress of a process is unknown, variable, or of short duration.
- Use for short durations, ranging from **1 to 9 seconds**, but preferably for very short wait times **(1 to 3 seconds)** [7-9].
- Use when you don't know what the data you've filled in might look like. For example, if you're loading a form (because they're not all structured in the same way) [10].
