# How to Report a New Bug in the Design System


To uphold and enhance the integrity of the Design System, it's essential to promptly report any bugs you encounter. 
This guide outlines a straightforward process for bug reporting, guaranteeing precise documentation. 
Your report will undergo categorization and tagging with '**_Triage_**', signifying its need for committee review. 
The committee convenes weekly to evaluate new issues and determine their priority for resolution. 

Before creating a new ticket, please search the Design System's [Kanban](https://equisoft.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/DS/boards/490?quickFilter=4017) 
and [Backlog](https://equisoft.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/DS/boards/490/backlog?customFilter=4017) using the component name to avoid duplicating entries for related bugs.


## Step-by-step instructions
Follow these steps meticulously to provide a thorough and actionable bug report.

### 1. Create a Ticket ###
    - Go to the [Design system board](https://equisoft.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/DS/boards/490).
    - Click the '**_Create_**' button in the header.

    - Select '**_Equisoft DS (DS)_**' in the '**_Project_**' field.

    - Select '**_Bug_**' in the '**_Issue type_**' field.

### 2. Fill in the Necessary Information ###
    - Provide a meaningful summary that includes the name of the component in brackets (e.g., [ComponentName]) followed by a concise bug summary.
        - Example: _[Button] click not triggering action_.
    <img src="bug-Summary.png" alt="Summary field" style={{ width: '355px', marginLeft: '30px' }} />
    - Complete the description with specific details about the bug, replacing any placeholders.
    <img src="bug-Description.png" alt="Description field" style={{ width: '470px', marginLeft: '30px' }} />
    - Save the ticket by clicking the '**_Create_**' button at the bottom of the modal dialog.

### 3. Ticket Placement and Labeling ###
    - The ticket will be moved automatically to the '**_Analysis_**' column on the Design System’s board.
    - The ticket summary will automatically begin with '**_New_**', indicating a new component, pattern, or bug.
    - It will be tagged with '**_Triage_**' for committee review and prioritization.

### 4. Weekly Review ###
    - Each week, the Design System Committee review new issues.
    - Once the Committee identifies the open issue as a bug, they prioritize it and move the tickets to the '**_TO DO_**' column for development.
    - For high-priority issues, contact the product owner or the person in charge via company communication tools (Slack, Teams).

### 5. Development and Resolution ###
    - If a Design System developer can meet the deadline, they will address the ticket.
    - If the deadline can't be met, the Design System product owner and the team reporting the bug will discuss about assigning it to the product team.
    - The developer assigned to the issue will address the bug following the usual development workflow.
    - Throughout this process, the ticket status will be updated accordingly on the Design System’s board.
    - The bug fix will be integrated into the next release cycle.

By following this process to report bugs, you help maintain the quality and reliability of the Design System. Your detailed and well-documented reports enable the Design System Committee to efficiently review and prioritize issues, ensuring timely fixes and improvements.
