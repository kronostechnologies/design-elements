## Definition
Modals are overlays that inform users about critical information and prompt them to take action [1]. When a modal appears, it redirects the user's attention from the main content to the modal itself.
<Canvas of={ModalDialogStories.Default} />

## Usage

### When to use
- Use when the content is urgent, and users are more likely to notice it in a modal [8].
- Use when it is essential to collect a small amount of information before letting the user proceed further [10].
- Use when you have to convey important information without losing the context of the current screen [10].
    - Note that even if it doesn't change the context, it will redirects the user's attention from the main content to the modal itself.
- Use when the user is about to take an action that has serious consequences and is difficult to reverse [9].

### When not to use
- Do not use when the content is excessive. Opt instead for concise content to ensure a smooth user experience. Complex
  modals can overwhelm users, indicating the importance of exploring simpler alternatives [5].
- Do not use for long forms. Consider employing separate pages for longer forms and inline editing for smoother user
  engagement [6].
- Avoid multi-step modals, which prolong user distraction and increase the likelihood of task abandonment. If it is
  necessary to use multi-step modals, progress indicators should be provided to keep the user engaged. It is also
  possible to consider the use of a complete page dedicated to this type of process [7].

## Variants

### Default
<Canvas of={ModalDialogStories.Default} />

### Alert
The alert modal requires confirmation for an action that is highly destructive or irreversible. This modal use an icon,
to help people with color vision impairment discern quickly the tone of the message. When there are significant
consequences for an action, and youâ€™re concerned users might skip the explanation, include an input to make sure the
user confirm the action [3].
<Canvas of={ModalDialogStories.AlertModal} />

## Properties
<ArgTypes of={ModalDialog} />

## Accessibility
It is important for users of screenreaders that other page content be hidden (via the aria-hidden attribute) while the
modal is open. To allow `ModalDialog` to do this, you should set `appElement` prop to a query selector identifying the
root of your app. For example, if your app content is located inside an element with the ID `root`, you should set the
`appElement` prop like this:

```jsx
<ModalDialog
    appElement="#storybook-root"
    isOpen={isModalOpen}
    onRequestClose={closeModal}
>
    Some Content
</ModalDialog>
```
