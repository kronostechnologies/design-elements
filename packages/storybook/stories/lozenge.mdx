## Definition
Lozenge is a notification component that allows users to easily identify and understand the status of items by using colour and emphasis.
<Canvas of={LozengeStories.Default} />

## Usage

### When to use 
- Use when you have to display a status. [2]

### When not to use 
- Do not use lozenges to categorize elements in a page; use the Tag component instead.
- Do not use lozenges to show counts or numerical figures; use thee Badge instead [4].
- Do not use lozenges as clickable elements.
- Do not use multiple lozenge components for one element as it can confuse users and dilute their visual impact.
