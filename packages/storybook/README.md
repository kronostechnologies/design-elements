# Design Elements Storybook

This [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) currently documents the [React](../react) implementation of Equisoft's Design Elements.

## Getting started

To run this Storybook, you need to build the [react](../react/README.md) package first. Then all you need to do is install the package's dependencies and run the `start` script:

```
cd design-elements/packages/storybook
yarn
yarn start
```

Storybook should then open automatically in your browser.
