# Feather Icons

Icon set intended for use in Kronos's apps like PureCloud.

As part of the design system initiative, these will eventually be
replaced by a new icon set intended for use in all of Equisoft's
products.

## Usage

`yarn add @equisoft/feather-icons`

`import walletIcon from '@equisoft/feather-icons/wallet.svg';`

## Optimization

These icons have been optimized via [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) prior publication, so you're good to go.
